# Windows Process Tracing

While Linux has `ptrace`, Windows allows you to trace processes using `CreateProcessA`/`OpenProcess`, `SuspendThread`/`ResumeThread`, `GetThreadContext`/`SetThreadContext`, and `ReadProcessMemory`/`WriteProcessMemory`.

This example spawns a child process and manipulates it to run to completion. Otherwise, the child process will continue forever (until it's terminated).

The disassembly was generated by running `objdump -d child.exe > dump.txt` on MSYS2 UCRT64.
